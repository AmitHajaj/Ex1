# Ex1
 This is the first part of excersize 1 an C++ course at Ariel university.
 This excersize is test's based programming, so this part would be only TESTS!
 
 ## About
 
 At this excersize we build a snowman from ASCII characters. The snow man will be built by the user's input. The input contain's 8 digit's, when each digit is in range 1-4.
 
`  
 _===_  
 (.,.)<br />
 ( : )<br />
 ( : )<br />`

Let's make him some friends. This will be the general pattern for our ASCII art snowpeople:

`HHHHH<br /> 

 HHHHH<br />
X(LNR)Y<br />
X(TTT)Y<br />
 (BBB)<br />`


The leading spaces and the parentheses are always the same for all snowpeople. The different letters represent sections of the pattern that can individually change. Each section has exactly four presets for what ASCII characters can fill it. By mixing and matching these presets for all eight sections, we can make a variety of snowpeople.
All Presets

(Notice that spaces are put on otherwise empty lines so the section shape is always correct.)
